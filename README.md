# Credit Risk Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing credit risk using a Random Forest classifier. The project involves data preprocessing, training a model, and evaluating its performance through various metrics and visualizations.

## Files in the Repository

- `DS5220_Credit_Risk_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for the credit risk analysis.
- `credit_risk_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the loan status (approved or not approved) based on various features such as age, income, employment length, loan amount, interest rate, etc. The Random Forest classifier is used for this purpose, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

## Results

The results of the analysis include:

- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC)
- Classification report
- Top 10 feature importances
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. The Random Forest classifier provides a robust solution for predicting credit risk based on the given dataset.
